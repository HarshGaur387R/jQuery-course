// *********************************************WHAT IS JQUERY****************************************************


// jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
// It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler.

// All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. 


// First, let's take a look at an example HTML manipulation with JavaScript.
// To get the element with the id="start" and change its html to "Go" we will need to do the following:
// var el = document.getElementById("start");

// el.innerHTML = "Go";
// JS
// To do the same manipulation with jQuery, we need just a single line of code:
// $("#start").html("Go");


// You will learn about the new syntax in the coming lessons, but as you can see, the code is much shorter and easier to understand.
// Another great advantage of jQuery is that you do not need to worry about browser support, your code will run exactly the same in all major browsers, including Internet Explorer 6!
